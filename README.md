# typing-tutor
A typing tutor made with Python for a real-world client. This project was completed as part of my IB Higher Level Computer Science course. This was an open ended task where the aim was to create a program for a real-world client. 

## Documentation

I documented the entire process of building this program. Inside of the `Documentation` folder you will find PDFs describing the planning, design, development, evaluation and an appendix of conversations with my client. 

A video of the program in action can be found in this folder as well. (Note: Sound on).

## Product

This is where you will find my program, as well as all of the CSV files the program uses. Feel free to download it and give it a go, or watch the video in the documentation folder to see the program in action.
