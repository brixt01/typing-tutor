# typing-tutor
A typing tutor made with Python for a real-world client. This project was completed as part of my IB Higher Level Computer Science course. This was an open ended task where the aim was to create a program for a real-world client. 

## Features

- Allows different users to create accounts and log into them
- Allows the user to choose different modes to practise their typing (speed or accuracy
focused)
- Takes user input from their keyboard
- Records which words/letters they get right/wrong the most
- Able to suggest words/letters more often if the user gets them wrong a lot
- Shows the user which words/letters they are best/worst at typing
- Shows the user how they have improved over time
- Allows different users to compare their scores with each other

## Repository structure

### Documentation

I documented the entire process of building this program. Inside of the `Documentation` folder you will find PDFs describing the planning, design, development, evaluation and an appendix of conversations with my client. 

A video of the program in action can be found in this folder as well. (Note: Sound on).

### Product

Inside of the `Product` folder you will find my program, as well as all of the CSV files the program uses. Feel free to download it and give it a go, or watch the video in the documentation folder to see the program in action.
